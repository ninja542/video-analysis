increasing the matrix that the median filter uses changes the area and radius a little
Using a 2x2 matrix introduces more noise however
Weird that 3x3 and 5x5 have less noise while 2x2 and 4x4 have more noise
Is 3x3 same as 7x7?
3x3 and 7x7 look similar, but will probably show differences with different test images

interesting: could try finding ellipses in the processed images (using python instead of mathematica) 
https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/25589/how-can-i-detect-an-ellipse-in-a-photo 

finding circles in matlab:
https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imfindcircles.html

finding approximately round things in matlab:
https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/identifying-round-objects.html
could just outline everything and try to find what's circular and take that as the flame
however, doesn't solve spikiness of white pixels

potential spike solution:
since pixels that are in a line ish from the spark plugs are usually attached to the left and right of the center of the circle
we can probably filter out the pixels that have black stuff on the top and bottom
might not work for two pixels high but you could probably have an if else statement like
if the bottom is white, check x many pixels below to see if it's black. X would be a threshold so that super thick things that are part of the flame don't get erased
would on detect the left right, middle ish of the image so bottom and top of the flame wouldn't get affected. 

would not solve random things attached to circle

adjusting curves in paint.net seems promising
levels is a bit more one dimensional
contrast and brightness also seem one dimensional

was thinking of just like a line follow detection thing? and spikes would be "dead ends" don't know how much that works
